HR Analytics â€“ Predict Employee Attrition

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

  This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using HR data. Employee attrition directly impacts business performance, so it is crucial for organizations to identify at-risk employees and take proactive measures.
  
  The project uses machine learning models to analyze employee demographics, work-related attributes, and satisfaction factors. Insights are then visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions for workforce retention.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

  Predict the likelihood of employee attrition.
  
  Identify key factors that influence attrition.
  
  Provide actionable insights through visualizations.
  
  Assist HR teams in designing effective retention strategies.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used

  Python: Data preprocessing, EDA, and model building
  
  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
  Jupyter Notebook: Experimentation and development
  
  Power BI: Interactive dashboards for visualization

ðŸ“Š Steps Involved

  Data Collection â€“ HR dataset with employee demographics, job roles, income, and work-life balance.
  
  Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identifying trends and correlations related to attrition.
  
  Model Building â€“ Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
  
  Model Evaluation â€“ Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
  
  Dashboard Creation â€“ Designed a Power BI dashboard to highlight predictions and key risk factors.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
